title: Who Am I?
---

My name is Beatrice Giudici and I am a PhD student at Universitat de Val√®ncia.

I am interested in supernova explosions and how the explosion connects to the star that originated it. 
In order to explore all the aspects of these fascinating phenomena, I rely on numerical simulations.
