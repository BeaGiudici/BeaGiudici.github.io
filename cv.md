## Work Experience

### 2019 - 2020

#### Tutor for the Bachelor-level course 'Astrophysics Laboratory'

The course introduces the techniques for observational astrophysics, allowing the students to have first experience in sources observation and signal calibration. The tutor has to help the students dealing with data analysis. This activity has been done remotely due to Covid-19 pandemic.

### 2018- 2020

#### LabEx Project

The project, held by the Department of Physics in the University of Milano - Bicocca, aims to bring the concepts of experimental physics to high school students, who will be able to reproduce some of the fundamental experiments in the history of physics by themselves.

### 2015 - 2019

#### Provate Lessons

Private lessons of physics and mathematics to high school and bachelor's students.
